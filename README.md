# Advent of Code 2020

I try to use a different language every day. However, if there are tasks that build upon each other (like in 2019), I'll try to stick to the same language.

To see how to run the solutions of each individual day, look at its main source file.

| Day | Problem                                                                   | Solution   | Language                                                    |
