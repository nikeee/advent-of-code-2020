# Advent of Code 2020
...with a different language every day.

To see how to run the solutions of each individual day, look at its main source file.

| Day | Problem                                                         | Solution   | Language                                                                | Problem/Topic/Solution                                                                                                        |

[Solutions and language ideas of 2019](https://github.com/nikeee/advent-of-code-2019)

## Conclusion
The intention to use a different language on each day was to try out new and old languages.
A huge part of this gives an idea of how hard it is to get started with the respective language.
Also, it may indicate what each language lacks or performes well in.

### General Observations
The older the language, the harder it seems to maintain good software engineering practices (for example: Perl, AWK).
However, the older the language, the more unusual it is. It seems that newer languages converge to each other (for example: Go, V, Dart).

### JavaScript
JavaScript could need some custom value types that can be used as keys in a `Map` or elements in a `Set`.
Classes don't provide `equals`/`hashCode` that would make this scenario possible.
There currently is a [proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-record-tuple) to add this to the language (as records and tuples).

### Python's `map`/`filter`/etc
Writing this in Python feels like the wrong way around since you have to think inside-out.
Being able to call `.map` etc. on lists would make the code much more readable.
Also, some kind of pipeline operator [like F#'s `|>`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/symbol-and-operator-reference/) could help.
[There seems to be interest in this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/4a83ip/python_pipe_operator_4_years_later/), but no PEP has surfaced yet.

### Interesting languages to try out

#### [V](https://vlang.io)
- Compiles really fast
- Intuitive (at least for me)
- No GC; automatic memory-management and ref-counted
- Time to get started: really fast
- Nice documenation
- Heavily inspired by Go; but only the good parts it seems
- The stdlib is simple and offers a lot for that early stage

#### [Zig](https://ziglang.org)
- Manual memory management
- Nice error handling (errors being part of the return _type_ of a function, not the function signature etc.)
- Interesting type system that offers compiletime and runtime checks
- As close to metal as C; seems like a good alternative to it
- Odd: The entire documentation basically consists of unit tests; this could be improved

#### [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org)
Alghough it has a Ruby-like syntax, it was easier to pick up than I thought it would be (for me).

### Somewhat strange language: [Haxe](https://haxe.org)
I get that it is a cross-platform language. It seems that it hasn't learned from Java.
Basic things are still missing like getting the size of a `HashMap<K, V>`.
